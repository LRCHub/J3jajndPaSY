The fire and the rain
The fire and the rain
I wanna feel the way you feel
I know you'll take me
up and down
But before you start
I will teach my heart
To be steely
And when I'm feeling lonely
And baby - sorry
I wanna get the feeling to
fight for you
And when you shine bright
Your love is real light
And I'll forget the pain just to
reach to you
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape
for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child -
you can really believe me
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape
for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child -
you can really believe me
The fire and the rain
I'm lookin' for a way to be
I'm never gonna let you down
Just in case you find
You can change your mind
And be leavin'
And when I'm feeling lonely
And baby - sorry
I wanna get the feeling to
fight for you
And when you shine bright
Your love is real light
And I'll forget the pain just to
reach to you
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape
for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child -
you can really believe me
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape
for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child -
you can really believe me
The fire and the rain
And when I'm feeling lonely
And baby - sorry
I wanna get the feeling to
fight for you
And when you shine bright
Your love is real light
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape
for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child -
you can really believe me
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape
for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child -
you can really believe me
The fire and the rain
